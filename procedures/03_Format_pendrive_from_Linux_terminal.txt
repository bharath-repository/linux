Format pendrive from Linux terminal ===> { FAT32 or ntfs or ext4 }

1] Insert pendrive

2] To list memory devices 

#lsblk
#blkid
#fdisk -l

For Eg: 

      Our pendrive /dev/sdb   16 GB


3] To create a parition with 

#fdisk /dev/sdb

>n      >>> new partition
>p      >>> primary partition
>enter  >>> partition number = 1 (default)
>enter  >>> first sector(default)
>enter  >>> last sector(default)
>w      >>> to write 

4] To update that in Operating system

#sudo partprobe

5] To make file system

	5.1] To format FAT32

	#sudo mkfs.vfat -F 32 /dev/sdb1   or   #sudo mkfs -t vfat /dev/sdb1    >>> here "-t" option for choose filesystem

	5.2] To format NTFS

	#sudo mkfs -t ntfs /dev/sdb1 -L knight     	>>> here "-L" option for label the partition /dev/sdb1
	
	5.3] To format ext4
	
	#sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb1	or 	#sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/sdb1
	

6] Unplug the pendrive start usign it




*) Write .iso file into pendrive from linux terminal

0] Do this below steps before iso file write into a pendrive

	*) keep in mind that partition shcema which is suitable for your computer (eg:) MBR or GPT
	*) legacy >>> MBR
	*) new    >>> GPT
	
	*) while you creating bootable pendrive for live boot os
	*) your pendrive should not be created with partition before write up .iso
	*) you should write (kali-linux.iso) file in pendrive like /dev/sdb   <<<  user $lsblk to find this 
								     /dev/sdc
								     /dev/sdd
	**)your pendrive must be whole single partition
		
		/dev/sdb >>>> is correct partition
		
		/dev/sdb1 >>> is not correct partition
							
	***)To avoid this issue 
	
		#mkfs.vfat -F 32 /dev/sdb   >>> here you giving the whole pendrive (/dev/sdb)
	
	     
1] List available storage

#lsblk
or
#blkid
or
#fdisk -l

	(eg:) 
	/dev/sda   500 GB
	/dev/sdb   28 GB    >>> we know the size to pendrive 	

2] To make file system FAT32 on pendrive (/dev/sdb)

#sudo mkfs.vfat -F 32 /dev/sdc

3] To confirm unplug and again plugin pendrive

4] Now you see that pendrive is mount 

#lsblk

5] To unmount the pendrive >>>> before start writing pendrive(/dev/sdb) must be unmount from everywhere

#sudo umount /dev/sdb

6] Check before start writing weather is it unmounted

7] To start writing iso file

#sudo dd bs=4M if=<path_to_.iso> of=/dev/sdb conv=fdatasync status=progress 

or 

$sudo dd bs=4M if=Downloads/ubuntu-19.04-desktop-amd64.iso of=/dev/sdb conv=fdatasync status=progress

8] Once the process is completed you can start booting from your operation system
