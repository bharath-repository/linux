*) Write .iso file into pendrive from linux terminal

0] Do this below steps before iso file write into a pendrive

	*) keep in mind that partition shcema which is suitable for your computer (eg:) MBR or GPT
	*) legacy >>> MBR
	*) new    >>> GPT
	
	*) while you creating bootable pendrive for live boot os
	*) your pendrive should not be created with partition before write up .iso
	*) you should write (kali-linux.iso) file in pendrive like /dev/sdb   <<<  user $lsblk to find this 
								     /dev/sdc
								     /dev/sdd
	**)your pendrive must be whole single partition
		
		/dev/sdb >>>> is correct partition
		
		/dev/sdb1 >>> is not correct partition
							
	***)To avoid this issue 
	
		#mkfs.vfat -F 32 /dev/sdb   >>> here you giving the whole pendrive (/dev/sdb)
	
	     
1] List available storage

#lsblk
or
#blkid
or
#fdisk -l

	(eg:) 
	/dev/sda   500 GB
	/dev/sdb   28 GB    >>> we know the size to pendrive 	

2] To make file system FAT32 on pendrive (/dev/sdb)

#sudo mkfs.vfat -F 32 /dev/sdc

3] To confirm unplug and again plugin pendrive

4] Now you see that pendrive is mount 

#lsblk

5] To unmount the pendrive >>>> before start writing pendrive(/dev/sdb) must be unmount from everywhere

#sudo umount /dev/sdb

6] Check before start writing weather is it unmounted

7] To start writing iso file

#sudo dd bs=4M if=<path_to_.iso> of=/dev/sdb conv=fdatasync status=progress 

or 

$sudo dd bs=4M if=Downloads/ubuntu-19.04-desktop-amd64.iso of=/dev/sdb conv=fdatasync status=progress

8] Once the process is completed you can start booting from your operation system





**) Making live persistence kali linux

0] To boot kali linux live OS

       *) Change the bios firmware boot sequence manually >> simply pointing to our pendrive >> (eg):press function key [F12 or F2 or F8 or F10 ]
      **) Select live persistence from GRUB menu
     ***) Run terminal once operating system started     

1] To see the partition of the flash drive

#fdisk -l

2] To enter into the flash drive

#fdisk /dev/sda

or 

#fdisk /dev/sdb

or

#fdisk /dev/sdc

3] Create partition using fdisk

n              >>>>   new partition
p              >>>>   for primary partition
first sector   >>>>   default value
last sector    >>>>   default value
w              >>>>   write the change into disk

#partprobe

4] To see newly created partition 

#fdisk -l

>>>>for example i've received output like 

/dev/sdb1 * boot partition
/dev/sdb2
/dev/sdb3 >>>> new created partition

5] To make file system for new partition(/dev/sdb3)

#mkfs.ext4 -L persistence /dev/sdb3

*** wait for a while ****

6] Label the new partition(/dev/sdb3)

#e2label /dev/sdb3 persistence

7] persistence mount directory

#mkdir -p /mnt/usb

8] mount (/dev/sdb3) to /mnt/usb directory

#mount /dev/sdb3 /mnt/usb

9] Create a file in persistence.conf

#echo "/ union" > /mnt/usb/persistence.conf

10] Unmount the partition

#umount /dev/sdb3

11] restart the system

#reboot
